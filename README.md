## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox + Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - utility-first CSS framework

### What I learned

- usage of the useState and useEffect hooks

### Known Issues

- Input values of Bill and Number of People don't change back to 0 when clicking "RESET"
- Not an Issue, but I intended to use Tailwind with this project but ended up skipping it for now. Might come back later and do the switch.

### Useful resources

- [React Docs - Hooks](https://react.dev/reference/react/hooks) - Learned about useState and useEffect hooks here
- [Codecademy Docs about React Hooks](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/react/hooks) - Another useful resource, not so detailed as the official docs
